                                            Our dojang embraced change when two young black belts, ages 12 and 13, went in front of the school's board of directors in
                                            April of 2013. They expressed the need for a reform after first-hand seeing a
                                            trend among their friends who quit after achieving the rank of black belt.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Daniel Hornback and Riley Hammar shared the struggles they themselves had faced
                                            in transitioning from color belt - where you test and achieve goals every few
                                            months - to not testing for years on end as a black belt. They also spoke about
                                            the increased responsibility of teaching and helping at branch level and how
                                            that reduced the time they had in the past used for training with their peers.
                                            The young black belts came to the board meeting prepared and proposed a solution
                                            to this by requesting permission to form a Black Belt Youth Group (BBYG). The
                                            plan was to hold class once a month where challenges would be a must and guest
                                            instructors were to be actively pursued.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> "We are young and itching to show the world what we can do, and if given a challenge,
                                            we will not disappoint!"
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Two Rivers Martial Arts BBYG has now hosted guests from grandmasters, masters,
                                            police officers, the FBI and private citizens with special training. They have
                                            sampled sword fighting, different types of sparring, and ground self-defense.
                                            They have been introduced to ALICE (the Active Shooter Response Program) and
                                            nunchakus and have had field trips to the Des Moines Police Academy's Firearms
                                            and Training Facility. After each class they meet at CiCi's for pizza and social
                                            time as this allows them to catch up with each other on a personal level and
                                            strengthen their friendships even more. Daniel Hornback explains: â€œWe all need
                                            to remember that first and foremost we began this journey as students. No matter
                                            what rank we achieve and students we train, in the core we are pupils only limited
                                            by our own imagination. What we have done with our group is remove the walls
                                            that separate us from other disciplines and extend invitations to other organizations/people
                                            for our continued growth. Incredible things have come of this; bonds are forged
                                            and experiences shared.â€ The impact and foresight of these two young black
                                            belts are nothing less than astounding.

                                                the Des Moines Police Academy's Fire Arms and Training coordinator, regular
                                                SWAT & SWAT -weapons of mass destruction team, with 17 years in law enforcement,
                                                who also served in the military with four oversees deployments and has taught
                                                protective services detail personnel in the private sector. He explains his
                                                interest for working with the group: "As a law enforcement officer, it is
                                                great to see such a nice group of kids with this level of dedication, discipline
                                                and respect. Martial artists are just like us, and I see a lot of carryover
                                                as our police training takes athleticism, coordination along with a great
                                                sense of responsibility. In martial arts you need those same qualities to
                                                make it to black belt." SPO Latcham explains that as they grow, the group
                                                would be great candidates for the police academy or other similarly structured
                                                environments.

                                            "It is not just good for the kids but for us as well. The police department likes
                                            the opportunity to interact with our community and shed a positive light on the
                                            police, as most people do not interact with law enforcement unless there is something
                                            wrong. This changes that and gives the kids a chance to get to know us in a stressfree
                                            environment, making it beneficial for both of our organizations."

                                            <br> Other guests have stressed the importance of staying out of trouble, excelling
                                            in school and surrounding yourself with good influences. This will play a big
                                            part in their chances to achieve the careers they want. It is especially important
                                            if they have government career ambitions, as even choices made at an early age
                                            will be considered.

                                            BBYG's creation, adds: "It's not only about us. As we're being taught different
                                            styles, we're also learning techniques to teach to other people and spread our
                                            influence beyond what we've ever imagined. We are the next generation. It's extremely
                                            important that we are able to pass on information that is as important as self-protection."

                                            <br> Another outgrowth of the group's success is that some of its members have chosen
                                            local colleges for their continued education, leading the BBYG to begin the development
                                            of a mentor/junior instructor program for the young members to progress to as
                                            they age.

                                            <br> Daniel Hornback and Riley Hammar were right on target when defining the need
                                            for young black belts to stay connected. They also serve as inspiration to the
                                            upcoming youths to forge ahead on those difficult days when their training might
                                            otherwise get the best of them. There are amazing adventures waiting for those
                                            who make it to the prestigious rank of black belt! That is, if you are under
