                                        Two Rivers Martial Arts teaches traditional Tae Kwon Do, but we are not a traditional martial arts school. We are traditional
                                        because we stress the five tenets - Courtesy, Integrity, Perseverance, Self-Control,
                                        and Indominantable Spirt - and because we practice a non-contact sparring style.
                                        We are non-traditional because we have no headmaster. Two Rivers is administered
                                        by a Board of Directors, which is almost unheard of in martial arts circles.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="assets/images/History/EricHeintz01.jpg" alt="Images" class="img-responsive rounded float-left history-trma-cont-img-left"> Two Rivers traces its roots to the Eric Heintz Black Belt Academy, and through Master
                                        Heintz, to Grandmaster Woo Jin Jung of
                                        <a href="http://www.jungstkd.com/">
                                            Jung's Tae Kwon Do</a> in Cedar Rapids. Master Heintz ran a traditional Tae Kwon
                                        Do school in the typical manner. He was one of Master Jung's best students and taught
                                        Tae Kwon Do at the YMCA in downtown Des Moines for years before opening his own school
                                        in the Wakonda Shopping Center. This is the "traditional" way a martial arts school
                                        is started. A student decides to go out on his or her own with the master's blessing.
                                        In martial arts, the bond between the student and teacher is very strong, and a student
                                        usually maintains the affiliation with his/her former master even after establishing
                                        his or her own school.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Two Rivers Martial Arts did not develop in the traditional way. During the early
                                        1990's, Master Heintz began to have health problems. He had an ulcer that eventually
                                        ended with the loss of his stomach. During his first absence of several months, the
                                        school's black belts taught classes, ran promotion tests, and carried on the day-to-day
                                        operations of the school. Mr. Heintz returned, resumed control of the school, and
                                        things returned to normal. Then he had a relapse, and the black belts again maintained
                                        the school. Finally, in 1995, Mr. Heintz again left the school to his black belts
                                        because of his illness and was able to return on only a few occasions. The black
                                        belts ran the school from 1995 through July 28, 1998, when the Eric Heintz Black
                                        Belt Academy officially closed.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> It was a hot Saturday afternoon, July 25, when we held our last meeting as Eric
                                        Heintz Black Belt Academy students in the lobby of Master Heintz's school. About
                                        a dozen or so black belts showed up. We sat on the floor in the lobby, because all
                                        the furniture had been moved out, the electricity had been turned off, and the dojang
                                        was dark.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> We were trying to decide how we could continue doing Tae Kwon Do in the way we had
                                        been taught. Some had already decided to quit and were conspicuous by their absence.
                                        One of Master Heintz's senior students was starting his own school in Ankeny. But
                                        for many of us, training there was not a viable option. We all had our own reasons.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> As we sat there in the dim light from the window, we were starting to realize that
                                        the only option we had, if we were to stay together and continue training, was to
                                        start our own school. A long discussion took place, and some students expressed an
                                        opinion that this idea wasn't going to work. Some instructors were concerned that
                                        their students would be left out in the cold if the idea didn't work, and they didn't
                                        want to take the chance that we could actually open a school within a short period
                                        of time.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> At the end of the meeting, someone said they would get together the branch instructors
                                        to see what they could come up with and let the rest of us know. We had run the school
                                        for Master Heintz for three years, why not our own? Those branch instructors, plus
                                        a few others as consultants, became the first Board of Directors, with Ms. Julia
                                        Freel as the first business manager.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> These students met almost weekly to form a non-profit corporation. Thanks to a generous
                                        financial contribution from a senior black belt, we were able to hire an accountant
                                        and an attorney, get insurance, and jump through all the bureaucratic hoops to become
                                        a legally recognized Tae Kwon Do school (and a non-profit organization). Everyone
                                        had an innocent optimism. We weren't sure what we were up against, but we somehow
                                        knew we could do it. That feeling seemed to spread to our accountant and lawyer.
                                        They worked with us, apparently without concern about when we could pay them in full.
                                        That further supported our confidence.

                                        <br> And during this early time, our business manager found places for us to train so
                                        we could continue our traditional Friday night brown and black belt class. We met
                                        in a community center on the east side for a while. We trained in one of the smaller
                                        Central Campus gyms (with no air-conditioning). We held our tests at several locations,
                                        including Carlisle.

                                        support from our superiors, who continued to press for a merging of all former Eric
                                        Heintz Black Belt Academy branches, and who continued to inform us that what we were
                                        attempting was a bad idea and we would certainly fail.
                                        <br>

                                        able to move into a home of our own, called the Hub. Our students and the parents
                                        of students took a gutted-out warehouse-type room and built walls, ceilings, created
                                        locker rooms, an office and storage area. We painted, laid carpet, had electrical
                                        work done, stained and hung doors, hung pictures, and did whatever needed to be done.
                                        Students did almost all of the work themselves. After working their own day jobs,
                                        they spent many an evening and weekend devoting their time, energy, and love to this
                                        project.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> The reason that it's call the Hub, and not the Main School, like when we were with
                                        the Eric Heintz Black Belt Academy, is because this location is just a centralized
                                        place for all branches to meet. It is no more important, or "main", than any other
                                        of our branch schools. Visualize, if you will, an old wagon wheel, and think of how
                                        all the spokes feed into a central hub. That's Two Rivers Martial Arts - one hub,
                                        many spokes.

                                        <br> It's been more than three years since we sat in that dimly light lobby and said,
                                        "Why not" - when everyone else said it won't work. Today Two Rivers Martial Arts
                                        is alive and well. We have added four brand new branches - Easter Lake and Weeks
                                        Middle School in Des Moines, Monroe Elementary in Monroe, and in Trenton, Missouri.
                                        We lost two of our original branches, Norwalk and Meredith, and we were joined briefly
                                        by the Methodist branch, which has since left to form it's own school. We now total
                                        twelve locations.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> We've grown financially, from scrimping by the first year to stability. We have
                                        enough income to pay the bills; we have a permanent location; and we've start setting
                                        aside funds for scholarships - both for people who can't afford to train in Tae Kwon
                                        Do and for our students heading off to college. We've done all this while charging
                                        fees that are approximately two-thirds what you'd pay at a typical for-profit martial
                                        arts school in Des Moines and other Iowa cities.

                                        <br> Two Rivers Martial Arts is a school run by its students. We are all volunteers.
                                        No one is paid to teach or serve on the Board of Directors. We do this so we can
                                        continue to practice Tae Kwon Do and to pass on what we've gained to the next generations
                                        of martial artists.

                                        who trained the primary instructors of Two Rivers Martial Arts. Masters Heintz and
                                        Bair began training in Tae Kwon Do in 1977 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa with Grandmaster
                                        <a href="http://www.woojinjung.com/"> Woo Jin Jung</a> (8th Dan).
                                        <br>
                                        <br> At the time Master Heintz was an attorney. He trained with Grandmaster Jung for
                                        many years and eventually began teaching as well. When his work took him to Ames,
                                        Iowa, Master Heintz began teaching Tae Kwon Do at the YWCA in nearby Des Moines.
                                        He continued to teach there part-time while working full-time as an attorney for
                                        several years. But as his love of Tae Kwon Do grew, his interest in working as an
                                        attorney full-time waned.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> In 1984 Master Heintz made the big leap and opened the main branch of the Eric Heintz
                                        Black Belt Academy in Des Moines, Iowa. Now that Master Heintz is retired, his black
                                        belt students carry on his tradition through Two Rivers Martial Arts.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> In addition to having owned and operated his own school, Master Heintz has also
                                        been a philanthropist. He and the Eric Heintz Black Belt Academy had a strong tie
                                        to a local charity called Amanda the Panda. Now that Master Heintz is retired, Two
                                        Rivers Martial Arts maintains that strong bond of support. Amanda the Panda is an
                                        organization dedicated to helping children and families through the grieving process
                                        when a loved one has died. Students and instructors at our academy support Amanda
                                        the Panda as volunteers, camp counselors, and with donations of material and money.
                                        In addition Master Heintz has organized board breaking marathons to raise funds for
                                        the charity on six occasions.

                                        six hours. More importantly, he raised approximately $1800 for Amanda the Panda in
                                        the process. Since then he has repeated the feat with 2000, 3000, and 4000 boards.
                                        Finally on Saturday August 27, 1994 Master Heintz broke 5000 boards in about eight
                                        hours. In 1995 his students took over the board breaking duties for a marathon which
                                        featured board breaking by more than 100 different students. In total Master Heintz
                                        and his students have raised over $60,000 for Amanda the Panda. The impact of his
                                        board breaks has been felt by hundreds of children and their parents who have received
                                        help from Amanda the Panda.

                                        <br> Master Kaye Bair (6th Dan) was the highest ranking student and instructor at the
                                        Eric Heintz Black Belt Academy and is one of the highest ranking women black belts
                                        in the Midwest of the United States. Master Heintz and Master Bair began training
                                        together under Grandmaster Jung in 1977.
                                        <br>
